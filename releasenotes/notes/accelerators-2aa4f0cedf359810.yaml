    the bare metal node for future scheduling. The accelerator devices will be
    saved to node properties under the key ``accelerators``. Introduces a
    configuration option ``[accelerators]known_devices`` to specify a
    configuration file which contains required information to identify
    accelerator devices, by default it uses the in-tree configuration file
    named ``known_accelerators.yaml``.
